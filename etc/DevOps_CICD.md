# What is devOps and CI/CD?

## DevOps
DevOps engineers’ job is to integrate the developers’ code and release the final product to the public so developers can solely focus on their code.

When developers push their codes with tests, they can be integrated to be a part of the whole program.

DevOps engineers do this by making an automation environment.

CI (Continuous Integration) is the developers’ job and CD(Continuous Deployment) is for devOps engineers’ job.
